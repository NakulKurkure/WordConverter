     <h2 className=" font-extrabold"> What is a privacy policy?</h2>
     <p className="font-medium mt-3" > A privacy policy is a legal document where you disclose what data you collect from users, how you manage the collected data and how you use that data. The important objective of a privacy policy is to inform users how you collect, use and manage the collected.</p>

     <h2 className=" font-extrabold"> Why is a privacy policy important?</h2>
     <p className="font-medium mt-3">The most important thing to remember is that a privacy policy is required by law if you collect data from users, either directly or indirectly. For example, if you have a contact form on your website you need a privacy policy. But you will also need a privacy policy if you use analytics tools such as Google Analytics.</p>

     <h2 className=" font-extrabold "> Where do I put my privacy policy?</h2>
     <p className="font-medium mt-3">Usually, you can find privacy policies in the footer of a website. We recommend that you place your privacy policy in easy to find locations on your website.</p>

     <h2 className=" font-extrabold ">Can I copy someone else's privacy policy?</h2>
     <p className="font-medium mt-3" >We do not recommend copying someone else's privacy policy. First of all, privacy policies are copyright-protected legal documents. But most importantly, a privacy policy must be generated based on the exact data you collect.</p>
